# Directories below the next two are absolute in either the `service` or `interaction` docker container.

# These are the files that will be "public" to the teams via the scoreboard.
# The paths are relative to the repository
# They are published manually. IF YOU CHANGE THEM DURING THE GAME YELL!

# Test scripts are heavily encouraged.
# All scripts should exit 0 if nothing went wrong.
# Scripts are automatically determined to be exploit scripts if they start with the word "exploit".
# Exploit scripts must output the flag using "FLAG: <FLAG>" and exit with 0 if the flag was captured correctly. 
# The paths are absolute in the `interaction` docker container.
interactions:
    - /check.py
    - /exploit.py

# This is how players will connect to your service
# REMOVE THIS IF YOUR SERVICE HAS NO NETWORK COMPONENT
# In the rare case that 'default' and 'guess' are not OK, you can specify your own values
# chalmanger will automatically add connection info to the public page (unless you add hidden: true)

# It's strongly suggested to have a healthcheck regex
# The infrastructure will periodically connect  and alert if it doesn't match anymore
#
# Example: healthcheck_tcp: awesome chall
#          healthcheck_tcp_send: some intial command
# Example: healthcheck_http: Author Login

# It's not actually read from the info.yml, but be ready to give it to Sean (/Jacopo/Yan/...)
# It will go in inventory/group_vars/all (git@github.com:o-o-overflow/dc2020q-infra)
#
# TODO: can we have a meaningful one without spawning VMs all the time?
healthcheck_tcp: Spawning the VM...
